UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS (FOR FUTURE RESEARCH)
================================================================================

1. What is optimal resolution/patch size for different satellite sensor types?
   - Optical (Sentinel-2, Landsat): Standard 256-512×256-512?
   - SAR (Sentinel-1): Different patch decomposition strategy?
   - Multi-spectral (>3 channels): How to adapt patch embedding?

2. How do these backbones perform on imbalanced RS datasets?
   - Most papers use balanced ImageNet; RS data often imbalanced
   - Class imbalance strategies (focal loss, resampling)?

3. Quantitative comparison of domain-specific vs generic pretraining?
   - PRITHVI (foundation model for RS): vs ImageNet-21k ViT
   - SatMAE (masked autoencoder for satellite): vs standard EfficientNet
   - SSL4EO (self-supervised learning): vs supervised baselines

4. Multi-temporal/multi-spectral architecture design?
   - How to adapt these backbones for time-series RS data?
   - Optimal channel ordering for 11-band Sentinel-2?
